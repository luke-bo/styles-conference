            <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>

            <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>

            <p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in film such as: cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>

            <h5>About Adam</h5>

            <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in Computer Science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services.

            <h5>The Business of Play</h5>

            <p>Play isn&#8217;t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a FourSquare account knows that &#8211; and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience isn&#8217;t about those surface elements either &#8211; it&#8217;s about creating an environment with well-understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you&#8217;re trying to encourage people &#8211; or yourself &#8211; to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game mechanics and play could be trump card you&#8217;re looking for.</p>

            <h5>About Carolyn</h5>

            <p>Carolyn Chandler has been working in the field of User Experience Design for over 14 years.

            <h5>Heavy Metal Coding</h5>

            <p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning &#8211; both of code and drum beats! You&#8217;ll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner&#8217;s heavy metal drum patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.</p>

            <h5>From Muppets to Mastery &#8212; Core UX Principles from Mr. Jim Henson</h5>

            <p>Jim Henson started working as a puppeteer in 1954, a fair 40-50 years before many of us even considered User Experience as a career. He did, however, take it upon himself to apply many of the core principles that UX Designers are falling love with today (or are at least using as part of our everyday lives). Hang out for a quick dive into the life of Jim Henson, with a view into his work from the perspective of how it pertains to what it is we&#8217;re doing today, that promises to even leave Waldorf and Statler happy.</p>

            <h5>Leveling Up with Flexbox</h5>

            <p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard of &#8220;flexbox,&#8221; short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout module and the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3&#8217;s wide array of new layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we&#8217;ve dealt with for over a decade. But with cross-browser support still incomplete, you&#8217;ve probably relegated flexbox to the &#8220;one day&#8221; pile of web design tricks.</p>

            <p>It&#8217;s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you that it&#8217;s a good idea to start learning and using flexbox today. You&#8217;ll learn how to take your designs—and web design skills—to the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.</p>
